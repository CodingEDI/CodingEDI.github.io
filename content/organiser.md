Coding in the Open is jointly organised by [EdinbR](edinbr.org) and [PyData Edinburgh](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Edinburgh/)

### EdinbR

EdinbR is the Edinburgh usergroup for the R programming language, and aims to
bring together scientists, statisticians and programmers from all over
Edinburgh to discuss R-related matters. We encourage collaboration between
local R users and organise training events for those interested in learning the
language. EdinbR meets monthly (on the third Wednesday of the month) and
welcomes new attendees, regardless of R knowledge.

[EdinbR](edinbr.org) is convened by

### PyData Edinburgh

Community. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and
developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The
global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches,
