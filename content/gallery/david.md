### Developing Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with open source software improves quality and trust in official statistics

Public Health Scotland is the primary producer of official statistics for the
NHS in Scotland and has around 200 public releases of data each year.
Production of these statistics using proprietary software can be time
consuming, resource-intensive and cumbersome. Reproducible Analytical Pipelines
utilises open source tools and combines data science best practice and
principles to effectively automate these processes to increase auditability,
efficiency and quality. These RAP projects are also produced in the open so
there is increased transparency and trust.
