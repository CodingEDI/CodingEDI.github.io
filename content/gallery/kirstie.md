### The Turing Way: Empowering researchers in reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative science

Although reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can
be trusted, it requires skills in data management, library sciences, software
development, and data ethics considerations: skills that are not widely taught
or expected of academic researchers. Beyond these skills lie the structural and
incentive barriers to working open. The Turing Way aims to provide a safe space
for data scientists in academia, industry, government and the third sector to
practice these skills and build open source materials covering version control,
analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent
communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects.
All attendees will leave Kirstie's presentation understanding the many
dimensions of openness and how they can participate in an inclusive,
supportive, kind and inspiring open source ecosystem as they seek to improve
research culture, making it "open for all".

### About Kirstie

Kirstie Whitaker leads the [Tools, Practices and
Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems)
Research Programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)
(London, UK). The TPS community's mission is to invest in the people who
sustain the open infrastructure ecosystem for data science. Kirstie is the lead
developer of [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), an
openly developed resource to inspire, train and enable researchers and citizen
scientists across government, industry, academia and third sector organisations
to apply open source practices to their work. She is a passionate advocate for
making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from
diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward
collaborative working. She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics
Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a [2016/17 Mozilla
Fellow for Science](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab). Kirstie was named,
with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global
Thinker](https://2016globalthinkers.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker)
by Foreign Policy magazine. You can follow her and her dog's adventures on
Twitter [@kirstie_j](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j).
