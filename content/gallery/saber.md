### Making a business and a sense of place from open source

Data is everywhere and without location, it is often difficult to make sense of
it. With the free and open source [https://inputapp.io](https://inputapp.io)
you can collect spatial data. The app is powered by QGIS software and allows
you a seamless link between mobile and desktop. Synchronisation of the data
between the devices and users is done using a git-like technology.
