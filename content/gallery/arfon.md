I’m a Staff Product Manager for Data at GitHub, supporting the work of our
data science and data engineering teams. Previously, I founded and led the Data
Science Mission Office at STScI in Baltimore – the home of Hubble Space
Telescope and other flagship NASA science missions. For those of you paying
attention, you might have noticed that I was at GitHub once before (2013–2016),
helping to bring open source to academia.
