### Data Maturity – A Fruitful Journey for the Not-for-Profit Sector

Data Orchard works collaboratively with others to build the data capabilities
of the not-for-profit sector. Since 2015 they have researching data maturity
and openly sharing their knowledge and resources. Their free online data
maturity assessment tool launched in October 2019 and has been used by hundreds
of non-governmental, public sector, universities and commercial organisations.
In this session, Sian Basker will reflect on how collaboration and openness
have created strong roots and are beginning to produce rich fruits in knowledge
and learning for advancing the sector.
