Coding In The Open is a week of 1 hour seminars happening June 14th - 18th,
online.

We aim to bring the discussion around Open Source *practices* - that
is, the collaboration across organisations to achieve bigger things - to a new
audience.

We've some fantastic speakers lined up from public, private, charity and academic
sectors to talk about what being "open" means to them, and how it improves
their world.
