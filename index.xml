We aim to bring the discussion around Open Source practices - that is, the collaboration across organisations to achieve bigger things - to a new audience.
We&amp;rsquo;ve some fantastic speakers lined up from public, private, and academic sectors to talk about what being &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; means to them, and how it improves their world.</description></item></channel></rss>
