Beyond these skills lie the structural and incentive barriers to working open. The Turing Way aims to provide a safe space for data scientists in academia, industry, government and the third sector to practice these skills and build open source materials covering version control, analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects.</description></item><item><title>Sian Basker</title><link>https://codingedi.github.io/gallery/sian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://codingedi.github.io/gallery/sian/</guid><description>Co Chief Exec at Data Orchard.

With the free and open source https://inputapp.io you can collect spatial data. The app is powered by QGIS software and allows you a seamless link between mobile and desktop. Synchronisation of the data between the devices and users is done using a git-like technology.</description></item><item><title>John A Stevenson</title><link>https://codingedi.github.io/gallery/john/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://codingedi.github.io/gallery/john/</guid><description>Going open is a process, not an event Software developer + postdoc geologist tweeting volcanoes, Iceland, GIS &amp;amp; open source science software.

EdinbR EdinbR is the Edinburgh usergroup for the R programming language, and aims to bring together scientists, statisticians and programmers from all over Edinburgh to discuss R-related matters. We encourage collaboration between local R users and organise training events for those interested in learning the language. EdinbR meets monthly (on the third Wednesday of the month) and welcomes new attendees, regardless of R knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Schedule</title><link>https://codingedi.github.io/schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 21:33:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://codingedi.github.io/schedule/</guid><description>To be announced - stay tuned!
